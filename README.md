# Team 9: <insert team logo here> <insert team name here> 


team home page, skills matrix, conceive your product


### Create your team's home page
The TTeam will create a repository for your team. This repo is for your team's documentation and source code. **The Github readme.md file has to be the jumping off point to your documentation.**  This repository and documetation should evolve over time with your project.  We encourage you to use the built in Wiki that Github provides, although you are free to use what feels most sustainable for your team as long as you link to it from your Github readme.md homepage. Examples of Wiki based documentation are available from the Home repository main page. Please note you typically will store your source code in this same repo as your documentation for a one stop shop experience. 

The team home page (readme.md in your team's home repo) should include at least the following:
- **Come up with a team name** Creativity encouraged. Vowels encouraged as well.
- **Design a logo** Design it yourself if you are so inclined. Grab open source assets if not.
- **Team member photos, names**
- **A synopsis of your proposed project**
- **Links for team communication:** how we should get in touch with you, how you keep in touch with each other - Slack, email, etc.
